What is Javascript
Javascript is the worlds most popular programming language 
javascript is easy to learn

javascript is used to create interactive and dynamic web pages.
it is responsible for adding functionality to a website and allows for user 
interactive with website content.

Javascript variables

var:
     var a = 20
     console.log(a)

     var is an global scope

let
     let a = 20
     console.log(a)

     {
          let a = 10
     }
     console.log(a)
     ###
     a is not defined

     let is an local scope

const
     const a = 20
     console.log(a)

     const --> is a constant variables

     constant a = 10
     a = 20
     console.log(a)

variables are containers for storing information or datatypes
javascript variables can be declared in 4 ways

using Var keyword - function scope or global scope
var x = 10;
{
     var y = 20;

}
console.log(y)
Output:
20(accessible outsie the block)

var price = 100
var product = "iphone 15"
console.log(product)
var total=price-tax
console.log(total)

Declare a Variable named "FruitName"
Declare a Variable named "Count"
Declare a Variable named "Price" and set it to the price of the FruitName
Declare a variable named "total" and calculate it by multiplying the "count"
by the "Price"
Print the name of the Fruit
print the total price of the Fruit

var fruitname = "Apple"
var count = 5
var price = 10
var total = count*price
console.log(total)


Javascript keywords

var
for
if
let
const
switch
function
return
try


javascript comments

javascript comments can be used to explain

Single Comments


//ooty Apple
var fruit ="Apple"
console.log(fruit)

Multiline Comments

/*

hello macha
ennada panra
*/


Javascript Operators

Javascript provides various operators that perform operations on values
or variables . these operators can be categorized into different types
based on their functionality

Operator types                     Operator
Arithmetic Operator                "+","-","*","/","%","**"
Assignment Operator                "=","+=","*=","/=","%="
Comparison Operator                "=="."/=","==","!==",">",">=","<="
Logical Operator                   "&&"
Bitwise Operator                   "&"
String Operator                    "+"
Type Operator                      "?"
Type operators                     "typeof","instanceof"
Unary Operator                     "+","-","!","-","typeof",delete,"void"

Increment Operator
the Increment Operator(++) is an Arithmetic operator in javascript that is used to increment the value
of a variable by 1. it can be used in two different ways

Pre Increment
let x= 5
let y =++x
//pre Increment: X is incremented to 6 and then assigned to y
console.log(x)//Output:6
console.log(y)//Output:6

Javascript datatypes
In programming, a data type is a classification or categorization of a value that determines the 
kind of operations that can be performed on it and the storage format used to represent it in memory.
Each programming language has its own set of datatypes and understanding them is essential for 
working with variables and performing operations on data

var a= 10
var b = "Apple"
console.log(typeof(a))
console.log(typeof(b))

Primitive datatype
Number              console.log(typeof(10))
String              console.log(typeof("Apple"))
Boolean             console.log(typeof(true/false))
Null                console.log(typeof(null))
Undefined           console.log(typeof(a))

Non Primitive datatype
Object
Array

Javascript functions

Javascript functions is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
A Javascript function is executed when something invokes it(calls it)

Syntax:
function <function name>(){ }

function add(){
     console.log("Hello World")
}
add()






Javascript Parameters

In Javascript , the term "Parameters" typically refers to the variables or placeholders that you 
define when declaring a function. these parameters serve as input to the function and allow you to 
pass data into the function when you call it.

function add(a,b)
{
     console.log(a+b)
}

add(10,20)


Exercise
Create a function called area()
this function should get 2 values are parameters (length,breadth)
pass two values to the funciton and print the result

Return type

n javascript, the return keywords is used within a function to specify the value that the 
function should produce as its result or return to the caller. when a function is executed and
encounters a return Statement, it immediately stops executing and returns the specified value to the
calling code. Heres how the return keyword works:

function name(){
     return "Prasanna"
}
var a = name()
console.log(a)

Exercise

create a function called add which should take 2 parameter a and b
and it should return the addition of two variables
